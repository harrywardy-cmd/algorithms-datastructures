# Algorithms & Data Structures








A personal collection of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving exercises implemented in Python .
This repository is designed for interview preparation, competitive programming, and improving core CS fundamentals.

## Purpose

This repo serves as:

A reference library of common algorithms and data structures

A learning resource for coding interviews and technical assessments

A practice ground for writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code
